## Installation

```bash
npm install --save-dev @yeger/turbo-graph
# or
yarn add -D @yeger/turbo-graph
# or
pnpm install -D @yeger/turbo-graph
```

## Usage

The visualization can be opened by running this package's `turbo-graph` command.
For simple usage, create a script in your root `package.json`.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "graph": "turbo-graph"
  }
}
```

Nodes represent your packages.
Each package can have multiple nodes, each color defining the corresponding task.

### CLI

Optionally, the CLI command can be followed by a list of tasks names that are loaded at startup.
E.g., `turbo-graph build test` will load `build` and `test` tasks.
Like the `--filter` option listed below, this only applies if the `--open` open option is used.

- `-f, --filter <filter>`: Filter nodes by a Turborepo filter (e.g., `my-lib...`).
- `-o, --open`: Open the visualizer in the default browser.
- `-p, --port <port>`: Port of the visualizer. (default: 29312)
- `-h, --help`: Display help message

### Controls

By double-clicking a task node, its package is used as the filter.
